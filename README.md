## decision_tree.py
Implements the recursive id3 algorithm and chooses best split based on maximum entropy decrease.

## decision_tree - bagging:boosting.py
Implements bagging and boosting to learn an ensemble of decision trees.

## pca.py
Calculates Principle Component Analysis and decomposes dataset into eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Plots cumulative variance chart.

## spectral_clustering.py
Implements spectral clustering of generated dataset using PCA and plots the kmeans labels.
